RTR is an implementation of a randomized thermal relaxation method. It
is described in

the Maximum Feasible Subsystem Problem. In M. Jünger, V. Kaibel (eds.),

Relaxation methods have been introduced by Agmon and by Motzkin and
Schoenberg in the '50s. Given a system of linear inequalities

A x ≥ b

these methods attempt to find a point x satisfying all these
inequalities as follows:

1. choose an initial x^0
2. set k=0
3. while (not (A x^k ≥ b)) {
4.    choose row (a^i, b_i) such that a^i x^k < b_i
5.    set x^(k+1) = x^k + alpha a^i
6. }

The implementation is a randomized, thermal variant that aims at
solving the MAXimum Feasible Subset (MAXFS):

  Given an infeasible system Ax≥b, find a feasible subsystem A'x≥b'
  that is of maximum cardinality, i.e., with the maximum number of
  rows.

Through option -o, one can output on a file (or stdout) the largest 
feasible subsystem found so far.
