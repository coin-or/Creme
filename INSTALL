Crème installation instructions
-------------------------------

The only external needed by Crème for now is BuildTools, which is only necessary if you do development work on Crème and which you can download as follows:

svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/BuildTools/stable/0.7 BuildTools

The rest is as usual:

mkdir build && \
cd build && \
../configure && \
make -s

File format and some sample instance files are described in the data/ directory.
